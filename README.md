Airbnb Data Analysis
This project explores Airbnb listing data with the goal of uncovering insights and patterns about the listings, hosts, and guests. The analysis was carried out in three distinct steps:

Data Cleaning: The dataset was cleaned to ensure accuracy and completeness, handling missing values, correcting inconsistent formatting, and removing duplicates. Necessary data transformations were applied to ensure compatibility for analysis.

Descriptive Statistics: Descriptive statistics were calculated to summarize key characteristics of the data, such as average prices, most frequent room types, and distribution of listings across different neighborhoods. Measures like mean, median, mode, and standard deviation were used to provide a foundational understanding of the dataset.

Data Visualization: Various visualizations were created to explore relationships between features, trends over time, and geographic patterns in the data. Charts like histograms, bar plots, and heatmaps were used to present findings in an intuitive and easily digestible format.
